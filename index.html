        <h1>IrisFlowerClustering</h1>
        <p>This project utilizes ML.NET to perform clustering on the Iris flower dataset. The goal is to group iris
            flowers into different clusters based on their features—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal
            width—without any prior knowledge of the flower types.</p>
        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, commonly used for classification
            and clustering tasks. In this project, we use ML.NET to create a clustering model using the K-Means
            algorithm. The dataset is divided into clusters, and each data point is assigned to one of these clusters
            based on the features of the iris flowers.</p>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The project involves the following steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Loading the Iris dataset into ML.NET.</li>
            <li>Processing the data to combine relevant features.</li>
            <li>Training the K-Means clustering model.</li>
            <li>Saving the trained model to a file for later use.</li>
            <li>Predicting the cluster of a new Iris data point.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Code Analysis</h2>
        <p>The code loads the Iris dataset, trains a clustering model using K-Means, and makes predictions on new data.
            Each flower is classified into one of three clusters based on its features.</p>
